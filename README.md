👋 Hi, I'm Panashe Chemhuru

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend engineering, API design, and the development of reliable, scalable systems.  
I enjoy solving complex problems, architecting clean solutions, and turning ideas into production-ready features. I’ve worked across banking, healthcare tech, and HR systems — environments where accuracy, uptime, and clear system design really matter.
